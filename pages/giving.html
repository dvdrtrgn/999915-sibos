                                    <p>CEMINA was founded by a group of women
                                        activists in Brazil who struggled to find a
                                        way to communicate with the public about
                                        aspirations, wishes, rights, and changes that
                                        women seek for themselves and for society as a
                                        whole. Through broadcast radio, CEMINA works
                                        to provide a platform for women to have a
                                        voice, air their opinions, and speak candidly
                                        about issues related to gender and human
                                        rights. Over the last decade, CEMINA has
                                        expanded to educate underserved communities of
                                        Brazil, providing access to a range of

                                    <p>On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0
                                        earthquake — the largest ever recorded in
                                        Japan — struck off the coast, with a resulting
                                        tsunami. Over 20,000 people were reported dead
                                        or missing and 20,000 houses were destroyed.
                                        300,000 people lost their homes. Through one

                                <li>&quot;When I landed in Darfur last year as
                                    part of an ARC humanitarian trip I realized how
                                    little humans need to survive. What overwhelmed me
                                    were the dignity and heroic qualities I
                                    encountered in the most desperate of situations. I
                                    will never be the same and I am blessed to have
                                    witnessed firsthand what the efforts of a few
                                    capable and well intentioned people have on their
                                    fellow human beings! &quot;</li>
