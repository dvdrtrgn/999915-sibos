                                        million in 19,500 nonprofits.</li>
                                    <li>The United Way Worldwide, for the fourth year in a row, named

                                    You are invited, for the third year in a row, to cast a vote for one of four nonprofits (noted below)
                                    that make a difference around the world. Based on this poll held at our Wells Fargo Sibos reception,

                                <p>CEMINA was founded by a group of women activists in Brazil who struggled to find a way to
                                    communicate with the public about aspirations, wishes, rights, and changes that women seek
                                    for themselves and for society as a whole. Through broadcast radio, CEMINA works to provide a
                                    platform for women to have a voice, air their opinions, and speak candidly about issues
                                    related to gender and human rights. Over the last decade, CEMINA has expanded to educate
                                    underserved communities of Brazil, providing access to a range of information and
                                    communication channels at low-to-no cost. </p>
