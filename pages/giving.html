                                    Campaign as the No. 1 Giving Campaign. </li>
                                <li>Wells Fargo team members volunteered 1.5 million hours and
                                    donated $70 million to nonprofits. </li>

                                You are invited, for the third year in a row, to cast a vote for one of four nonprofits (noted below)
                                that make a difference around the world. Based on this poll held at our Wells Fargo Sibos reception,
                                Wells Fargo will donate a total of USD$10,000 to these four charities.</p></td>
